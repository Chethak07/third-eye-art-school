        <h1>About Our Art School</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Third Eye Art School</strong>, a creative space where children learn to express 
            themselves through colors, shapes, and imagination. We believe every child is born creative and 
            our mission is to help them discover the artist inside.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our classes are designed to be fun, interactive, and inspiring. With professional guidance, 
            children explore different art forms such as drawing, painting, craft work, and various creative 
            techniques that build confidence and skill.
        </p>

        <p>
            We aim to create an environment where creativity blossoms and imagination becomes art.
